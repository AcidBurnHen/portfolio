# Marin Luic - Portfolio

- Hello, this is my portfolio project

## Basic Design Layout

- I created the design on figma, and first focused on creating the layout in which my content will be displayed,
  when coding this website.

## Next steps

- Setup planned file hirerarchy and created empty components in them
- Setup react router in app and used Link to navigate it through the sidebar.
- Installed postcss to use for styling
- I coded the sidebar and did the styling for it and for the background.

## HomePage

- Started working on homepage
- Created the page based on the design file
- Written tests for the HomePage component with RTL and Jest
- I decided to add animation to the text effect
- Used typedjs, useEffect and setTimeout to do it.
